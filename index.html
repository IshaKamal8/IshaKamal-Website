        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. I am a biology major and hoping to attend medical school in the near future. I have had many great experiences while studying at this University and I hope to cherish these memories forever. I have learned so much about myself and what I wish to do throughout these four years. I am now in my last quarter and can not believe how fast time actually flew by. I hope that I can properly utilize what I learned at this University in all my future endeavors. I made so many valuable friendships with people I know will always be a part of my life. <br><br>

       I still remember being a little freshman attending UCR and excited to see what the next four years of my life would have in store for me. Now that it’s all over its crazy to see how fast life actually goes. This past spring quarter was meant to be something I could really value and a time to make a few memories with people who mean so much to me. Unfortunately, the current pandemic did not allow any of us to have the proper goodbyes that we had planned for and always thought about. Even though the current circumstances are extremely sad, I know that I will at least always have all the other memories to always appreciate. I wish the situation could have been different; but, if there’s anything that I have learned over these past few years, it’s that life never waits for anyone and that anything can happen at any moment. That’s why it’s so important to appreciate every second of your life. I feel extremely blessed to have so much support not only from my family but my friends as well. I have a lot of schooling left in the future and while that scares me, I am also very excited to start a new chapter of my life with a completely blank slate. <br><br>

       I have volunteered at the hospital and been a part of COPE Health Scholars. I have completed over 100+ hours in volunteering for Kaiser Permanente. Also, I have volunteered to help provide food, clothing, and assistance for the underprivileged at a local food bank. I have also been a part of the Sikh Student Association to become more culturally aware and learn more about Sikhism. I hope to use all that I have learned through my experiences to possibly further my career in the healthcare field. I hope to one day become a doctor specializing in Internal Medicine. I plan on studying for the MCAT this summer and taking it by August. I want to begin my medical school career in 2021 and hopefully, I am successful with this plan. I have always dreamed of being a part of medicine and I hope that I have the strength and determination to follow through with this plan. I hope that I can one day not only make my family proud but also be able to make myself feel proud and truly accomplished with all my goals.
